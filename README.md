# Weather-Forecast

*Assignment Objective*

- Your primary task is to develop a machine learning model that corrects weather forecasts for the meteorological station at Ukkel. You will use these forecasts as inputs and the temperature at Vlinder19 as the target value. The preprocessing approach and model design are up to you, but you should implement the regression models discussed in the TAI lectures.

*Project Scope*

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

- Collect weather forecast data and corresponding temperature measurements at Vlinder19.
- Clean and preprocess the data as needed.

*Model Development:*

- Implement various regression models to correct the forecasts.
- Train the models using the preprocessed data.

*Evaluation and Results:*

- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Select the best-performing model.

*Presentation:*

- Present your findings, including model design, selection, preprocessing choices, and results.
